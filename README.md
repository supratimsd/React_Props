# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh








In React, props is a short form for "properties", and in a words, it is a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable. It is used to customize or configure a child component by providing it with values or functions.

#STEPS OF PASSING PROPS==>
STEP_1=>Passing Data from Parent to Child
STEP_2=>Receiving Props in the Child Component
